title: "Scientific Questions and Hypotheses"
teaching: 10
exercises: 5
questions:
- "What makes a good scientific question or hypothesis?"
objectives:
- "To compose a strong scientific question"
- "To differentiate between questions that describe a distribution,
  relationship, comparison, or composition"
keypoints:
- "Strong research questions and hypotheses direct the goals of data collection and analysis. They have clearly defined answers with deliberate investigation."
- "A well detailed research question can be answered with a good chart."

## Gapminder Ignorance Project

[Gapminder][about-gapminder] is a "fact tank" from Sweden that maintains data and teaching resources about global development. Gapminder promotes a fact-based
world view from a deeper understanding of reliable statistics. From their data,
we can begin to formulate some research questions to explore:

What are the major trends in global populations and economies?

How is the world population distributed among countries and continents?

How is population linked to economies and health?

Has that changed over time?

## Good Research Questions

Good research questions are falsifiable/verifiable with data. They are well-defined and have a clear research outcome or set of outcomes.

## Research questions lead to clear data visualizations.
