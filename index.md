This lesson shows how to choose the appropriate graphic to represent your data
and research question, inspired by [Choosing a good chart][good-chart], and then 
how to implement construction of the graphic using `ggplot2`.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Learners must understand basic data management and manipulation. They have
> likely worked with spreadsheets and interactive stats tools (SAS, R), are
> familiar with tabular data structure, filtering and summarizing data in
> groups, and basic statistics (mean, stdev, lm) to compare groups.
>
> Learners should have some limited programming experience in R, including
> content from Lessons 00 - 04 of Data Carpentry's
> [analyzing ecological data in R][R-ecology-lesson]. This specifically includes
> how to load a CSV (`read.csv()`), and basic `dplyr` function (`filter()`,
> `summarize()`, etc.)
>
> Learners must install R and download the gapminder data before class starts:
> please see the [setup instructions][setup] for details.
